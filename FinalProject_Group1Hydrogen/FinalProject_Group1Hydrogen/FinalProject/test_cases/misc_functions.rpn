# Test misc. math functions swap, pop, abs, sign, recip, chs, min, max
# floor, ceil, round, trunc, fact

# Tests go here.
# Start the stack with a few values
# Push 5 and 3 onto the stack
5
3

# Swap the top two values
swap
# Stack is now: 3 5

# Push a negative value and test abs, sign, chs
-7
abs
# Stack is now: 3 5 7 (abs converts -7 to 7)
chs
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 (chs changes the sign)

# Add 10 to the stack
10

# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 10

# Test sign
sign

# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 1 (sign returns 1 if positive, -1 if negative, 0 if 0)

# Add a -1 to the stack
-1

# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 1 -1

# Add
+
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 0


# Push reciprocal
2
recip
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 0 0.5 (reciprocal of 2 is 0.5)

# Test pop (removes top of stack)
pop
pop

# Stack is now: 3 5 -7

# Test min and max
5
9
min
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 (min of 5 and 9 is 5)
4
8
max
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 (max of 4 and 8 is 8)

# Test floor, ceil, round, trunc
7.8
floor
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 7 (floor of 7.8 is 7)
6.1
ceil
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 7 7 (ceil of 6.1 is 7)
4.5
round
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 7 7 4 (round 4.5 down to 4)
5.9
trunc
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 7 7 4 5 (truncates 5.9 to 5)

# Test factorial
3
fact
# Stack is now: 3 5 -7 5 8 7 7 4 5 6 (factorial of 3 is 6)

# Should be zero or very small here so add to previous % error

# This should add all the numbers on the stack together
# Value should be 44
44
# Integration test that runs this script will confirm that
# the final result is zero or very small.
